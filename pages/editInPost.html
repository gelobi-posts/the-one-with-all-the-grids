				</li>
				<li>

			<h2>What about Photoshop CS5/6?</h2>

			<p>
				Right now, Griddle only works with Photoshop CC, but surely we can make a version for CS6 and maybe CS5. If you need Griddle for those versions of Photoshop, please let us know (via <a href="#">email</a> or <a href="#">twitter</a>), so that we know we should work on it.
			</p>

			<h2>Source Code</h2>

			<p>
				Griddle is free and open-source. The source code is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/AriaMinaei/griddle">github</a>.
